A simple full stack project to learn a little js/html/cs. A python backend runs using flask, which can be queried by a js frontend to produce random Adrian Chiles headlines produced by html parsing the Guardian website. There isn't much value separating between frontend and backend here, but it's more a learning exercise than anything else.

usage:
python3 ./backend/app.py
npx http-server ./frontend
